            <p>What is fumigation ?</p>
            <p>
              The National Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (NSPM) -11
              defines fumigation as application of any chemical in a gaseous
              state in a gas tight enclosure to kill insect and other pests.
              According to the National Pest Control Association of America
              (NPCA), fumigation is the introduction of a toxic gas into a space
              in a high enough concentration so that the gas fills all areas to
              kill target insects.

            <p>What is a fumigant?</p>
            <p>
              A fumigant is a chemical at a particular temperature and pressure
              that can exist in gaseous state in sufficient concentration and
              for sufficient time to be lethal to insect and other pests.

              What are the commonly used fumigants for commodities in India?
            </p>
            <p>
              Methyl Bromide and Phosphine are the two most common fumigants
              used for treating raw commodities, processed food and wooden
              packaging material. In hospital settings and pharmaceutical
              manufacturing, ethylene oxide fumigation is used for
              sterilization.

            <p>
              What are the differences between Methyl Bromide and Phosphine gas
              ?
            </p>
            <p>
              Methyl Bromide (MBr) is a liquid under pressure that turns into a
              gas when released after heating. It is stored in cylinders or
              cans. MBr is highly penetrative, can kill insect eggs, highly
              toxic to a broad spectrum of insects and similar pests, and is
              lethal even in relatively short exposure periods (typically 24
              hours for non-perishables). However, it reacts with food
              containing high levels of fat, certain types of rubber, etc, and
              is forbidden for some commodities.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Aluminium Phosphide (ALP) when allowed to react with atmospheric
              water vapour, produces phosphine gas. It is available in tablet
              form. ALP exposure periods are higher (typically 72 hours) and is
              not lethal to all insect eggs. However, ALP can be safely used for
              oil seeds and fatty foods like cashew nuts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both fumigants are highly toxic to humans and pets, and oprations
              have to be performed in a precise manner in the fashion prescribed
              by the national standards, as the fumigation treatments involve
              complex procedures.{" "}

            <p>How do I decide which fumigant to use for my cargo?</p>
            <p>
              The Plant Protection Adviser to Government of India issues
              notifications from time to time (PQ orders) relating to the
              fumigant and dosage to be used for different commodities. In case
              of shipments to Australia, only Methyl Bromide fumigations are
              acceptable.

              Fumigation of Wooden Packaging (including dunnage) is mandated
              under the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures
              (ISPM) -15, which recommends using Methyl Bromide only. If you are
              in doubt, contact the nearest Plant Quarantine station, or a
              reliable fumigation company.

              Will fumigating wooden pallets and boxes get rid of Fungal
              infection?
            </p>
            <p>
              No. Methyl bromide is very effective against insect pests, but is
              not lethal to commonly found fungal species. If you wish so, Aqua
              &amp; Arthropods Pest Control can perform anti-fungal treatment
              for your wooden packaging material.
